# A puzzle about 100 dwarfs and lights

### Android

## App description

There is a famous puzzle that is:

There are 100 light bulbs in the room in hairdressers in ascending order,
And there are 100 dwarves entering the room.<br>
The first dwarf presses each bulb, and leaves<br>
The other dwarf presses every second bulb, and leaves<br>
The third dwarf presses every third bulb and leaves<br>
And so on..<br><br>

The riddle is: What lights will stay on at the end of the process?<br>

Here are screenshots of the app, and there is also an .apk file for installing my app<br>

I also put chesets into the game, if you press and hold the buttons there, and you get more options.
